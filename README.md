Website for SERUM Tutorial at WACV 2023, *January 7, 2PM to 5PM* 

Hosted by [Tejas Gokhale](https://www.tejasgokhale.com/) and [Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/) (Arizona State University)

## Description
In the past decade, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in computer vision -- the connection between vision and language (V+L) is now an integral part of AI.
V+L comprises of human-interactive tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, visual dialog, visual entailment and grounding, V+L navigation, and text-to-image generation.
This field has already had an impact on other research communities such as NLP, robotics, graphics, and direct industrial implications for software, arts, media, and journalism.
As V+L models become widely adopted, new types of challenges and failure modes are emerging, that have not been studied by previous work on robustness.
Multi-modal tasks involving both vision and language (V+L) inputs, open up intriguing domain discrepancies that can affect model performance of test time.

In this tutorial, we will show how semantic data transformation -- i.e. data transformation guided by the knowledge of logical and semantic features of natural language, can 
- help improve the robustness of V+L models,
- enable weakly supervised learning in cases with limited or no human-annotated datasets,
- enhance the quality of outputs in generative settings such as captioning, and 
- guide the design of reference-free evaluation metrics for captioning.

Each section of the tutorial will have two components:  
1. a lecture component, where the method will be described and relevant papers and results will be discussed, and
2. a hands-on demo session where participants can use the data engineering tools during the tutorial, and explore how they could be useful for benchmarking or as data augmentation.
